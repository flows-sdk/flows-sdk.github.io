# Introduction to Flows SDK

`flows_sdk` is a library that assists with programmatically defining Flows - sequences of actions managed and executed by the Hyperscience platform.

Flow definitions are first defined as a source using classes from the library. They are then converted to an importable format that can later be deployed on a Hyperscience instance.

The definitions are like blueprints - they configure and wire together Triggers, Blocks and other parameters, while the Hyperscience platform takes care of the execution and lifecycle during the actual runtime.

# Basic Concepts

## Flow

Flows are like processing blueprints that the Hyperscience platform can manage and execute. Within a Flow, Blocks are wired together to define the order of operations alongside Triggers, Flow inputs, and other helper components.

## Block

Using `flows_sdk`, Blocks can be defined and ordered and their inputs can be customized and passed in a static or dynamic fashion.

The actual execution and lifecycle of the blocks are managed by the Hyperscience platform.

There are several types of blocks (e.g. atomic, composite, system), but from the perspective of wiring a Flow together, all of them can be abstracted as simply "Block"

## Triggers

Triggers are a special type of block that can initiate Flow runs (e.g. Folder Listener, Message Queue)
