# Introduction to Flows SDK

`flows_sdk` is a Python library for programmatically building Flows: a sequences of business steps managed and executed by the Hyperscience Platform. We encourage you to complete the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) as the best way to get started.

Flow definitions are first defined as a source using classes from the library. They are then converted to an importable format that can later be deployed on a Hyperscience instance.

The definitions are like blueprints - they configure and wire together Triggers, Blocks, and other parameters, while the Hyperscience platform takes care of the execution and lifecycle during the actual runtime.

The code used to build Flows via `flows_sdk` is managed externally from the Hyperscience platform (e.g., in a separate git repository), while the produced artifacts can be uploaded to and managed by the Hyperscience platform.

## Requirements

- Development: The only local requirement for development is `python 3.7+` and
a link to this library, provided by your CX representative. Additional dependencies will later be pulled via `pip`.
- Deployment: In order to deploy Flows built using the `flows_sdk`, you need:
    - A running instance of the Hyperscience Platform (`v30` and above)
    - A user account with permissions to edit and import Flows

% Comment: @vik is v30 and above correct? I thought we could only do v32 and above?
