# Basic Concepts

## Flow

Flows are like processing blueprints that the Hyperscience platform can manage and execute. Within a Flow, Blocks are wired together to define the order of operations alongside Triggers, Flow inputs, and other helper components.

## Block

Using `flows_sdk`, Blocks can be defined and ordered, and their inputs can be customized and passed statically (e.g., during Flow definition or via. UI-exposed setting) or dynamically (e.g., output from a previous Block).

Execution and lifecycle of blocks is managed by the Hyperscience platform.

## Routing

A system Block that routes execution to one of its branches based on a condition (similar to a `switch..case` statement).

## Fork

A system Block that schedules other blocks for parallel execution.


## Triggers

Triggers are a special type of block that can initiate Flow runs (e.g., watching a folder for new files,
checking an inbox, listening to a message queue, etc.)
