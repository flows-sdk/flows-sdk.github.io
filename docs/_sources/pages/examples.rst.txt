=============

This section contains examples of fully executable flows. We recommend using one of these examples as a template for building a Flow to fit your exact business process.

Examples marked "OOTB" (i.e. "Out-of-the-box") contain any releases, models, and sample documents necessary to execute the flow in your instance of the Hyperscience Platform.

Hello Flow
###########

This example consists of a single Custom Code block. It is the simplest possible executable flow.

:download:`Download hello_flow.py <../../../samples/hello_flow/flow.py>`

IDP Starter
###################

This example is a snapshot of our V32 Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) flow. It uses both Machine and Manual blocks to:

1. Classify and collate pages
2. Identify and transcribe text
3. Additional manual transcription for any fields marked for review 
4. Output results to a downstream system

IDP w/ Custom Code Block
###########################

This example is identical to the :ref:`pages/examples:IDP Starter` example, however it includes an additional Custom Code block to add "time completed" metadata to each document in the submission. This is an example of how Custom Code blocks can arbitrarily modify extracted data before outputting to downstream systems.

Invoice Validation
###########################

This example validates invoice line items and the total invoice amount and routes to a Flexible Extraction block for discrepancies.

:download:`Download invoice_validation.zip <../../../samples/invoice_validation/invoice_validation_v32.zip>`

.. include:: ../../../samples/invoice_validation/invoice_validation_v32/invoice_validation.py

PDF Redaction
###########################

This example allows redaction of fields in a PDF by performing REGEX on fields/segments and blacking out corresponding bounding boxes.
