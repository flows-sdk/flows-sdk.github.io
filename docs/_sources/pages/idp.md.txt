# IDP Library

This IDP Library (`flows_sdk.implementations`) includes the latest performant blocks and functions for building **intelligent document processing (IDP)**.

The IDP Library contains:
- Processing Blocks, which are provided as convenient Python subclasses for plug-and-play use.
- Trigger and Output Blocks, which require use of [base classes](flows_sdk.blocks.IOBlock).
- Helper functions for ease of development.
% Comment: need to add simple subclasses of Trigger and Output blocks

```{eval-rst}

.. note::
   Most solutions will also require use of base classes, such as `Flow` or `CodeBlock`, found in the :ref:`pages/source-docs:Source Documentation`.
