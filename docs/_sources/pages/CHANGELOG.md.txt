# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.0

- [feature] `reference_name` is now an optional property for all blocks.

It's still a good idea to provide meaningful reference names when instantiating blocks,
but if the property `reference_name` is not set, a unique one will be generated.

before:
```python
submission_bootstrap = SubmissionBootstrapBlock(reference_name='submission_bootstrap')
// {"reference_name": "submission_bootstrap" }
```

after:
```python
submission_bootstrap = SubmissionBootstrapBlock()
// {"reference_name": "auto_submission_bootstrap__1" }
```

- [bugfix] Fixed a bug where IDP Starter V32 would not work on Hyperscience platforms after 32.0.9.
There are now two separate examples - one for 32.0.0 to 32.0.8 and another one for 32.0.9+

## 0.8.0

- [feature] Introduces the `implementation.idp_v33` package that contains block definitions used by
v33 of the Hyperscience platform
- [example] Added an IDP Starter Example that uses v33 blocks
